In summary, I have used react scalfolding feature for frontend, redux for state management, laravel for the Api end points and 
passport laravel package for personal access token implementation with bearer token auth


How to install and run the application


NOTE: Please for version consistency, use php version 7.1.3 or 7.2 but the latest php version does not work( php 8.0)

1. After Unzipping the project, create .env in the root directory of the project(. files are skipped during compression on ubuntu)

2. copy the contents in the env.txt and paste it in the .env file you created in step 1 above


3. start the apache server

4. create a database called trailanalytics

5.Incase if your database username and and Dabase password on your machine is different from .env, please check tha DB_USERNAME and  DB_PASSWORD to 
match what you have configured

6. open a commandline tool and change (CD) into the project directory

7.After step 6, type php artisan migrate and enter (If you have not made errors in the previours steps and you are using a supported php version
, all the tables created should be migrated  to the database)


8. After step 7 is succesful, again in the command line type, php artisan passport:install (Don't mind when you see Encryption keys already exists error);

9. After step 8, in the same commandline type php artisan DB:seed to create the first user in database;

10. Lastly, enter php artisan serve, to start the server and copy the generated url shown when the server is running, paste in the broswer, Thats all


Good Luck with the process....
